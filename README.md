Classic Problem: Car mpg Prediction

I did this data analysis project in a company recruitment test, but later found this is a very classic topic that almost every statistics app want to use it as a showcase. Hence I post it here and make it public. Since I got a few interviews during this project, I actually finished it in fractional time. So there may be some flaw. I am very happy if anyone help me figure out my mistake. If the data is classied and not appropriate for share, please let me know, I will make it private.
